"Hi, Are there any books, tools or resources that specifically focus on MLOps on the edge (with unstable Internet connectivity). For example resources that focus on model deployment, data collection, continuous training of models on the edge ?<br><br>A lot of the MLOps books and resources I have seen focus on the general machine learning use cases (e.g model stores, feature stores, batch vs stream etc ). Also most of the tools that I have seen work when the product is deployed on the cloud. I have rarely seen tools and system design approaches for Deep learning and computer vision on the edge.",-0.128
