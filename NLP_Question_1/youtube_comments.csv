link is not working. deployment happened perfectly

Thank you very much Krish. The yaml file you used is not exactly the one from Github actions. Can you please make a video about how you customized it?
kisiko kuchh samajhme aya kya?
thank you sir for making such an amazing contents ‚ù§
Guys anyone knows if everything done here is free ?
Your efforts and passion for teaching are amazing. thanks. can you please make videos on github actions and CICD pipelines on a more detailed level?
"Hi, Are there any books, tools or resources that specifically focus on MLOps on the edge (with unstable Internet connectivity). For example resources that focus on model deployment, data collection, continuous training of models on the edge ?<br><br>A lot of the MLOps books and resources I have seen focus on the general machine learning use cases (e.g model stores, feature stores, batch vs stream etc ). Also most of the tools that I have seen work when the product is deployed on the cloud. I have rarely seen tools and system design approaches for Deep learning and computer vision on the edge."
"Hi Krish, can you please show the demo of adding unit testing in CICD pipeline"
Thank you so much Mr.Krish  for share video for iNeuron student
Thank you so much Mr.Krish  for share video for iNeuron student
Hey Krish stuck in continuous deployment for more than 2 hrs Please help
Very Good series  Krish . It would be great if you will add mlflow .<br>.
Can I do all this in amazon free tier ?? Before practicing I want to be sure that no money would be deducted. Kindly guide sir. @Krish Naik
can you please make a video on how to deploy using vercel deployment please ..
hi krish is it possible to deploy custom yolo5 model with this??
"sir, live machine learning notes are not available .<br>can you re upload it in community"
Hi sir my question is how to make lensa app?
These videos are wonderful. Will there be any content on model monitoring and continuous retraining? That would be an incredible addition to this series
Sir Still We are Not received Our reimbursment Of Rajasthan IT Day Hackthon...üò¢
"I am writing to express my disappointment regarding the reimbursement promise made during the Hackathon event that I participated in Rajasthan. As per the agreement, it was promised that the traveling expenses would be reimbursed, but unfortunately, I have not received any reimbursement to date."
"PLEASE DO A COMPLETE VIDEO ON HOW TO<br><br>1. Load data<br>2. Exploratory data analysis<br>3. Data preprocessing like feature encoding, scaling,  (numerical and categorical) with pipeline, sampling the target, using PCA<br>4. Classification using traditional machine learning<br>5. Classification using neural network<br><br><br>Please do one video with all these together. With Target feature being a categorical variable.<br><br><br>WOULD MEAN THE WORLD TO A LOT OF US TO UNDERSTAND MACHINE LEARNING PROPERLY WITH ALL THESE METHODS"
thank you krish can you upload a video for environments that is offline (the internet is not allowed). CI/CD
Please could you make same video with respect to GCP
Thank you sir for the tutorial.
Hi sir can you make a video √≤n if we want to  deploy a  prediction model and w√® also want to create visualisation automatically based on the data input by the us√®r how can we do that.
"Awesome Sir ...Thanks<br>Sir,Can you please make one project with batch prediction and deployment with schedule and monitoring tools <br>This will be very helpful for all the fresher and experienced candidates"
Thanks Sir
